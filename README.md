Hi! 

This is a A modular document search engine implemented in C++ that supports Boolean queries (AND, OR, DIFF) over indexed text and Markdown documents.

This project demonstrates object-oriented design, inheritance, polymorphism, data structures, and file parsing using the C++ Standard Library.


How to build and run: In your C++ v.14+ compiler, run make, which produces the ./search-shell compiler, and then run it using any .txt file you want by ./search-shell path/to/index.txt

Example commands (HAS To BE UPPER CASE) 

AND term1 term2
OR term1 term2
DIFF term1 term2
PRINT page.md
INCOMING page.md
OUTGOING page.md
QUIT

Thank you for reading!
